# Cursor AI Agent Guidelines

This document provides specific instructions for Cursor AI when working with the AI Chatbot project. Follow these guidelines to effectively navigate, understand, and modify the codebase.

## Documentation Hierarchy

When approaching this project, consult documentation in the following order:

1. **Project Overview** (`docs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md`): Start here for a high-level understanding
2. **Component Architecture** (`docs/COMPONENT-ARCHITECTURE.md`): Understand how components interact
3. **Comprehensive Guide** (`docs/COMPREHENSIVE-GUIDE.md`): Get detailed technical information
4. **Specific Guides**: Only after understanding the overall architecture, consult specific guides:
   - `docs/API-INTEGRATION.md` for API-related tasks
   - `docs/ARTIFACT-SYSTEM.md` for artifact-related tasks
   - `docs/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` for development workflows

## Project Structure

The project follows this structure:
- `/app`: Next.js app router pages and layouts
  - `/(auth)`: Authentication pages (login, register)
  - `/(chat)`: Chat application pages
- `/components`: React components, organized by functionality
- `/lib`: Utilities, services, and helper functions
- `/docs`: Project documentation
- `/public`: Static assets

## Code Modification Guidelines

When modifying code:

1. **Maintain Component Structure**:
   - Respect the component hierarchy in `docs/COMPONENT-ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - Keep UI components separate from business logic
   - Follow existing patterns for state management

2. **API Integration**:
   - The project currently uses mock API services (`lib/services/mock-api-service.ts`)
   - When working with API code, reference `docs/API-INTEGRATION.md`
   - Maintain compatibility with the planned real API structure

3. **Message Handling**:
   - The `Chat` component is the central orchestrator (`components/chat.tsx`)
   - Messages follow a specific format defined in `lib/ai/types.ts`
   - Message rendering is handled by the `Message` component (`components/message.tsx`)

4. **Artifact System**:
   - Artifacts are special content types (text, image, sheets)
   - Reference `docs/ARTIFACT-SYSTEM.md` when working with artifacts
   - Artifact rendering is handled by specialized viewer components

## Troubleshooting Guide

When troubleshooting issues:

1. **For Message Display Problems**:
   - Check that message IDs are unique
   - Verify message format matches expected interface
   - Inspect the message flow from API to UI

2. **For API Communication Issues**:
   - Check the mock API service implementation
   - Verify callback functions are properly called
   - Ensure promise chains are properly handled

3. **For UI/UX Issues**:
   - Consult Tailwind classes and shadcn/ui component documentation
   - Check responsive behavior across breakpoints
   - Verify animation states and transitions

## Best Practices

Follow these best practices when working with the codebase:

1. **TypeScript**:
   - Use proper types for all variables and functions
   - Leverage TypeScript interfaces defined in `lib/ai/types.ts`
   - Avoid using `any` type except when absolutely necessary

2. **Component Structure**:
   - Create focused, single-responsibility components
   - Use memo for performance optimization where appropriate
   - Follow the existing pattern of separating pure components from memoized exports

3. **State Management**:
   - Use React Context API for global state
   - Use local component state for UI-specific state
   - Utilize custom hooks to encapsulate complex logic

4. **Code Style**:
   - Follow existing code formatting patterns
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Add comments for complex logic but keep code self-documenting

## Implementation Tips

When implementing new features or fixing bugs:

1. **New Feature Implementation**:
   - First understand how similar features are implemented
   - Reference the comprehensive guide for architectural patterns
   - Follow existing patterns for state management and component organization

2. **Bug Fixes**:
   - Understand the full component lifecycle before making changes
   - Check for any side effects your changes might introduce
   - Verify fixes across different message types and scenarios

3. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Focus on memoization and component rendering optimization
   - Consider impact on mobile devices
   - Test with large message sets to ensure scalability

## Information Gathering

When you need more information:

1. **Check Comprehensive Guide** (`docs/COMPREHENSIVE-GUIDE.md`) for detailed technical context
2. **Look at related components** to understand patterns and relationships
3. **Reference similar implementations** in the codebase for guidance

Always prioritize understanding the existing architecture and patterns before making significant changes to ensure consistency and maintainability.
