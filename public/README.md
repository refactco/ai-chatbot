# Public Assets

This directory contains static assets that are served directly by the web server.

## Contents

- `/images/` - Directory containing static image assets
- `mockServiceWorker.js` - Service worker script for MSW (Mock Service Worker)

## Purpose

The `public` directory in Next.js serves files from the application root. Any file placed in this directory will be accessible from the root of your application.

For example:
- `public/images/demo-thumbnail.png` is accessible at `/images/demo-thumbnail.png` 
- `public/mockServiceWorker.js` is accessible at `/mockServiceWorker.js`

## Usage Guidelines

1. Only place static assets in this directory that need to be served as-is
2. Do not reference files in this directory using relative paths in your code
3. Use the correct public URL in components: `/images/filename.ext` not `public/images/filename.ext`
4. Avoid placing JavaScript files here except for special cases like service workers
5. The mockServiceWorker.js file should not be modified manually as it's generated by MSW

## Special Files

### mockServiceWorker.js

This file is part of the Mock Service Worker (MSW) library used for API mocking during development. It should not be modified directly as it's generated and managed by MSW.

The service worker intercepts network requests during development to provide mock API responses for testing and development purposes. In production environments, this file should not be deployed.
