# Artifact System

## Overview

This document details the artifact system in the AI Chatbot, which allows the AI to generate and share specialized content such as documents, images, and data tables.

Artifacts are special types of content that can be generated by the AI and displayed in a dedicated panel in the UI. They provide a richer experience beyond simple text messages, allowing for interactive documents, images, and structured data.

## Artifact Types

### Text Artifacts

- **Description**: Formatted text documents with Markdown support
- **File Extension**: .md
- **Used For**: Essays, documentation, code snippets
- **Implementation**: `artifacts/text/client.tsx`

### Image Artifacts

- **Description**: Visual content generated by the AI
- **File Formats**: PNG, JPG
- **Used For**: Diagrams, charts, illustrations
- **Implementation**: `artifacts/image/client.tsx`

### Sheet Artifacts

- **Description**: Tabular data in spreadsheet format
- **File Format**: CSV
- **Used For**: Data tables, structured information
- **Implementation**: `artifacts/sheet/client.tsx`

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### Artifact Component (`components/artifact.tsx`)

- **Description**: Main container for the artifact panel
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Controls visibility and state
  - Integrates different artifact viewers
  - Manages version history and document storage
  - Implements dual-storage approach (API and localStorage)
  - Provides debounced content saving
  - Shows saving status indicators
  - Handles responsive layout for mobile and desktop

#### DataStreamHandler (`components/data-stream-handler.tsx`)

- **Description**: Manages streaming data for artifacts
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Processes artifact deltas as they arrive
  - Updates the artifact state in real-time
  - Manages streaming status indicators

#### ArtifactMessages (`components/artifact-messages.tsx`)

- **Description**: Specialized message display for artifacts
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Shows interactions related to the current artifact
  - Provides context for artifact creation and modifications
  - Handles input specifically for the artifact context

#### VersionFooter (`components/version-footer.tsx`)

- **Description**: Manages version history interface
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Allows navigation between document versions
  - Provides version restoration functionality
  - Displays timestamp information
  - Shows version count and navigation controls

### Hooks and State Management

#### useArtifact Hook (`hooks/use-artifact.ts`)

- **Description**: Central hook for artifact state management
- **Features**:
  - Provides global artifact state
  - Includes selector pattern for optimized rerenders
  - Manages artifact metadata
  - Uses SWR for state persistence
  - Maintains initial state configuration

#### Artifact Context Flow

- Artifact state is managed globally through SWR
- Components access state via `useArtifact` hook
- State updates are propagated efficiently to minimize rerenders
- Metadata is stored separately from core artifact data

### Attachment Structure

#### Interface

- **type** (string): 'image', 'text', 'sheet', or with '-delta' suffix
- **name** (string, optional): Optional name for the attachment
- **content** (string, optional): The actual content (base64 for images, text for others)
- **url** (string): URL reference, often with 'artifact:' scheme
- **title** (string, optional): Title displayed in the artifact header

## Data Flow

### Artifact Creation

1. User sends a message that triggers artifact generation
2. AI responds with an initial message
3. AI streams artifact data as attachments with '-delta' type suffix
4. DataStreamHandler processes these deltas and updates the UI
5. Artifact panel becomes visible showing the generated content

### Artifact Interaction

1. User interacts with the artifact (edits text, views image, etc.)
2. Interactions are processed by the specific artifact viewer
3. Changes can be sent back to the AI as messages
4. AI can respond to changes or provide further content
5. Content changes are debounced to prevent excessive version creation

## Document Storage

### API-Based Document Storage

- **Description**: For production environments, documents are stored via API
- **Features**:
  - Documents are fetched from `/api/document?id=${documentId}`
  - Updates are posted to the same endpoint
  - Versions are managed on the server side
  - Authentication and access control handled by the API
  - Uses SWR for data fetching, caching, and optimistic updates

### Local Document Storage

- **Description**: For development or special document types
- **Features**:
  - Documents with `local:` prefix use local storage
  - Special URIs (http://, text:, sheet:) automatically use local storage
  - Document history is stored in browser localStorage
  - Each edit creates a new version with timestamp
  - Versions can be navigated, compared, and restored
  - Key format: `local-document-${documentId}`
  - Same UI and interaction patterns as API storage

### Storage Detection

- **Local Storage Triggers**:
  - Document IDs with `local:` prefix
  - URLs starting with `http://` or `https://`
  - Content identifiers like `text:` or `sheet:`
  - Placeholder image URLs
- **API Storage**:
  - All other document IDs use API-based storage
  - Integration with authentication system

## Version Control

### Version Creation

- Each edit automatically creates a new version
- Versions include timestamps and content changes
- Debounced saving prevents excessive version creation
- Visual indicator shows saving status

### Version Navigation

- Users can move between versions using toolbar controls
- Navigation includes previous, next, and latest version options
- Current version status is clearly indicated
- Version comparison is available via diff mode

### Version Comparison

- 'diff' mode allows comparing changes between versions
- Toggled via toolbar button or version navigation
- Special UI state shows comparison view
- Consistent interface across both storage backends

### Version Restoration

- Users can restore previous versions
- Restoration works for both API and local storage documents
- After restoration, the system returns to edit mode with the restored content
- The restored version becomes the latest version in the history

## User Interface

### Split Panel Layout

- **Desktop**:
  - Left panel (400px): Shows messages related to the artifact
  - Right panel (remaining width): Displays the artifact content
  - Both panels scroll independently
  - Smooth animations for transitions
- **Mobile**:
  - The interface adapts to show only the artifact content for better usability
  - Full-screen layout optimized for smaller screens
  - Specialized controls for touch interaction

### Animations

The artifact interface includes smooth animations for:

- Opening and closing the artifact panel
- Transitioning between versions
- Showing/hiding the version footer
- Indicating saving status
- Smooth modal animations using Framer Motion

### Responsive Design

- **Desktop**: Split panel with messages and content
- **Mobile**: Full-screen artifact view with optimized controls
- Adaptive sizing based on window dimensions
- Custom hook (`useMobile`) assists with responsive behavior

## Testing

### Commands

- **test image artifact**: Generates a sample image
- **test text artifact**: Creates a text document
- **test sheet artifact**: Produces a spreadsheet
- **artifact testing**: Reference `docs/ARTIFACT-TESTING.md` for detailed test procedures

## Backend Integration

### Steps

1. Replace sample content generation with actual AI-generated content
2. Implement proper artifact storage (S3, database, etc.)
3. Leverage the existing version control system
4. Implement authentication for artifact access
5. Add collaboration features for shared artifacts

## Recent Improvements

- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimized experience across device sizes
- **Enhanced Hooks**: New useArtifact hook for better state management
- **SWR Integration**: More efficient data fetching and caching
- **Advanced URI Detection**: Automatic detection of special document types

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Diff Visualization**: Better visualization of changes between versions
- **Advanced Export Options**: Additional export formats for artifacts
- **Integration with External Tools**: Connect to third-party services
- **Offline Support**: Improved capabilities when working without network connection
