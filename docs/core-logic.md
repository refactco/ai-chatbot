# Core Logic

This document outlines the core business logic, data flow, and key algorithms in the application.

## AI Integration Logic

### Model Selection and Configuration

Located in `/lib/ai/models.ts` and `/lib/ai/providers.ts`

The application supports multiple AI models through a unified interface. The core logic includes:

1. **Model Registry**: Definition of available models
2. **Provider Configuration**: Connection details for different AI providers
3. **Model Selection**: Logic to select and initialize specific models
4. **Parameter Management**: Management of model parameters (temperature, top-p, etc.)

### Prompt Engineering

Located in `/lib/ai/prompts.ts`

The application uses engineered prompts to guide AI behavior:

1. **System Prompts**: Define the AI's personality and behavior
2. **Function Calling**: Enable AI to use tools and functions
3. **Context Management**: Manage conversation context and history
4. **Specialized Instructions**: Task-specific instructions for the AI

### Chat Processing

The application processes chat interactions through:

1. **Message Normalization**: Convert different input types to a unified format
2. **Context Building**: Assemble relevant context for the AI
3. **Response Processing**: Parse and format AI responses
4. **Stream Handling**: Process streaming responses for real-time display

### Tool Usage

Located in `/lib/ai/tools/`

The application enables AI models to use various tools:

1. **Tool Definition**: Specification of available tools
2. **Function Calling**: Logic for AI to call functions
3. **Result Processing**: Handle the results of tool usage
4. **Error Handling**: Manage errors in tool execution

## Data Management

### Database Interactions

Located in `/lib/db/`

The application uses Drizzle ORM for database interactions:

1. **Schema Definition**: Define database tables and relationships
2. **Query Building**: Construct and execute database queries
3. **Migration Management**: Handle database schema migrations
4. **Connection Pooling**: Manage database connections

### Session Management

Located in `/app/(auth)/auth.ts`

The application manages user sessions through:

1. **Session Creation**: Create new sessions on login
2. **Session Validation**: Validate session tokens
3. **Session Expiration**: Handle expired sessions
4. **Session Storage**: Store session data in database

### File Storage

The application stores files using Vercel Blob:

1. **Upload Handling**: Process and store file uploads
2. **Retrieval**: Fetch stored files
3. **URL Generation**: Generate URLs for file access
4. **Cleanup**: Remove unused files

## Core Workflows

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials
2. Credentials are validated against database
3. If valid, session is created and stored
4. User is redirected to main application
5. Session is validated on subsequent requests

### Chat Conversation Flow

1. User sends message
2. Message is stored in database
3. Message is sent to AI service
4. AI generates response
5. Response is streamed to client
6. Response is stored in database
7. Conversation history is updated

### Artifact Creation Flow

1. User requests artifact creation
2. Request is validated
3. Artifact content is generated
4. Artifact is stored in database and blob storage
5. Artifact reference is added to conversation
6. UI is updated with new artifact

### Document Processing Flow

1. User uploads document
2. Document is stored in blob storage
3. Document content is extracted and processed
4. Document metadata is stored in database
5. Document is available for AI to reference

## Key Algorithms

### Chat History Management

The application implements algorithms for:

1. **Message Grouping**: Group messages by sender and time
2. **Context Window Management**: Manage the size of the context window
3. **History Pruning**: Remove older messages when context size exceeds limits
4. **Relevance Scoring**: Determine which messages are most relevant to the current conversation

### Text Processing

The application processes text through:

1. **Markdown Parsing**: Convert markdown to HTML
2. **Code Highlighting**: Highlight syntax in code blocks
3. **Link Detection**: Detect and format links
4. **Content Sanitization**: Sanitize user input to prevent XSS

### AI Response Handling

The application processes AI responses with:

1. **Stream Chunking**: Process streaming responses in chunks
2. **Tool Call Detection**: Detect and handle tool calls in responses
3. **Markdown Formatting**: Format responses as markdown
4. **Error Recovery**: Handle and recover from errors in AI responses

## Error Handling

The application implements comprehensive error handling:

1. **Input Validation**: Validate user input before processing
2. **AI Service Errors**: Handle errors from AI services
3. **Database Errors**: Handle database connection and query errors
4. **Authentication Errors**: Handle authentication and authorization errors
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
6. **Fallback Responses**: Provide fallback responses when services fail

## Performance Optimization

The application implements several performance optimizations:

1. **Request Batching**: Batch multiple requests to reduce overhead
2. **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data
3. **Lazy Loading**: Load components and data only when needed
4. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections
5. **Stream Processing**: Process streaming data for real-time updates
