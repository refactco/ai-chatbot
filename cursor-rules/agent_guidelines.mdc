# Cursor AI Agent Guidelines

This document provides specific instructions for Cursor AI when working with the AI Chatbot project. Follow these guidelines to effectively navigate, understand, and modify the codebase.

## Documentation Hierarchy

When approaching this project, consult documentation in the following order:

1. **Project Overview** (`docs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md`): Start here for a high-level understanding
2. **Component Architecture** (`docs/COMPONENT-ARCHITECTURE.md`): Understand how components interact
3. **Developer Guide** (`docs/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md`): Get practical development guidance
4. **Specific Feature Documentation**:
   - `docs/ARTIFACT-SYSTEM.md` for artifact-related tasks
   - `docs/VERSION-CONTROL-SYSTEM.md` for version control features
   - `docs/MOCK-API-INTEGRATION.md` for mock API implementation
   - `docs/REAL-API-INTEGRATION.md` for real API integration

## File Documentation Requirements

When creating new files or modifying existing ones, always ensure these three steps are completed:

1. **Add a File Description Comment Block**:

   - Every file must begin with a JSDoc-style comment block describing its purpose
   - Include key features and functionality provided by the file
   - Note any important caveats or limitations
   - Example:
     ```tsx
     /**
      * Chat Layout Component
      *
      * This component provides the layout structure for all chat-related pages.
      * Features:
      * - Sidebar for navigation and user profile
      * - Responsive layout that can be toggled open/closed
      * - Pyodide integration for Python execution in the browser
      *
      * The layout wraps all chat pages and ensures consistent UI across the chat section.
      */
     ```

2. **Add Inline Documentation**:

   - Add explanatory comments for major sections of code
   - Use JSDoc comments for functions and methods with parameter descriptions
   - Wrap complex logic in comments explaining the purpose and approach
   - Example:

     ```tsx
     // Configure Geist font with Latin subset
     const geist = Geist({
       subsets: ['latin'],
       display: 'swap',
       variable: '--font-geist',
     });

     /**
      * Generates a chat title from the first user message
      * @param message - The user message to extract title from
      * @returns A string title created from the first few words of the message
      */
     export function generateTitleFromUserMessage({...
     ```

3. **Use Component Section Comments**:

   - Break up larger components into logical sections with descriptive comments
   - Each major part of a component (header, form, etc.) should have a section comment
   - Example:

     ```tsx
     return (
       <div className="...">
         {/* Header section with title and description */}
         <div className="...">
           <h3>Sign In</h3>
           ...
         </div>

         {/* Login form with email, password inputs and submit button */}
         <div className="...">...</div>
       </div>
     );
     ```

These documentation requirements must be applied to all new files created and any existing files that are substantially modified. Proper documentation improves code maintainability and makes it easier for other developers to understand the codebase.

## Project Structure

The project follows this structure:

- `/app`: Next.js app router pages and layouts
  - `/(auth)`: Authentication pages (login, register)
  - `/(chat)`: Chat application pages
- `/components`: React components, organized by functionality
- `/artifacts`: Artifact type implementations (text, image, sheet)
- `/hooks`: Custom React hooks for state management
- `/lib`: Utilities, services, and helper functions
- `/docs`: Project documentation
- `/public`: Static assets

## Code Modification Guidelines

When modifying code:

1. **Maintain Component Structure**:

   - Respect the component hierarchy in `docs/COMPONENT-ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - Keep UI components separate from business logic
   - Follow existing patterns for state management

2. **API Integration**:

   - The project currently uses mock API services (`lib/services/mock-api-service.ts`)
   - When working with API code, reference `docs/MOCK-API-INTEGRATION.md` and `docs/REAL-API-INTEGRATION.md`
   - Maintain compatibility with the planned real API structure

3. **Message Handling**:

   - The `Chat` component is the central orchestrator (`components/chat.tsx`)
   - Messages follow a specific format defined in `lib/ai/types.ts`
   - Message rendering is handled by the `Message` component (`components/message.tsx`)
   - Data streaming is handled by `DataStreamHandler` component

4. **Artifact System**:

   - Artifacts are special content types (text, image, sheets)
   - Reference `docs/ARTIFACT-SYSTEM.md` when working with artifacts
   - Artifact types are defined in `/artifacts/{type}/client.tsx`
   - The main container is `components/artifact.tsx`
   - State management uses the `useArtifact` hook from `hooks/use-artifact.ts`
   - Version control features are documented in `docs/VERSION-CONTROL-SYSTEM.md`
   - Artifact has a dual-storage approach (API and localStorage)

5. **Storage Patterns**:

   - Documents can use API-based or localStorage backends
   - Special document IDs (with prefixes like `local:`) use localStorage
   - Special URIs (http://, text:, sheet:) automatically use localStorage
   - Version history is maintained consistently across both storage types
   - SWR is used for data fetching, caching, and state management

6. **State Management**:
   - Use the SWR library for data fetching and global state
   - Use custom hooks (useArtifact, useMobile) for optimized state access
   - Leverage debouncing for expensive operations like content editing

## Troubleshooting Guide

When troubleshooting issues:

1. **For Message Display Problems**:

   - Check that message IDs are unique
   - Verify message format matches expected interface
   - Inspect the message flow from API to UI

2. **For API Communication Issues**:

   - Check the mock API service implementation
   - Verify callback functions are properly called
   - Ensure promise chains are properly handled
   - Check SWR configuration and caching

3. **For UI/UX Issues**:

   - Consult Tailwind classes and shadcn/ui component documentation
   - Check responsive behavior across breakpoints
   - Verify animation states and transitions

4. **For Artifact System Issues**:

   - Verify artifact type is registered in `artifactDefinitions`
   - Check localStorage for document versions with prefix `local-document-`
   - Inspect version history and navigation functionality
   - Examine console logs for artifact operations
   - Check the useArtifact hook implementation

5. **For Version Control Issues**:
   - Verify version navigation functions work as expected
   - Check both API and localStorage backends
   - Inspect debounced content saving
   - Verify version timestamps and ordering

## Best Practices

Follow these best practices when working with the codebase:

1. **TypeScript**:

   - Use proper types for all variables and functions
   - Leverage TypeScript interfaces defined in `lib/ai/types.ts`
   - Avoid using `any` type except when absolutely necessary

2. **Component Structure**:

   - Create focused, single-responsibility components
   - Use memo for performance optimization where appropriate
   - Follow the existing pattern of separating pure components from memoized exports

3. **State Management**:

   - Use SWR for global state and data fetching
   - Use React Context API for deeply nested state
   - Use local component state for UI-specific state
   - Utilize custom hooks to encapsulate complex logic
   - Use `useArtifact` hook for artifact state management

4. **Code Style**:

   - Follow existing code formatting patterns
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Add comments for complex logic but keep code self-documenting
   - Prefer inline conditions over "&&" condition in JavaScript and TypeScript
   - Use object property logging pattern for console.log statements

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use debouncing for expensive operations (like content editing)
   - Implement custom equality checks for memoized components
   - Be mindful of large document sizes in version history
   - Use selector pattern for optimized rerenders

## Implementation Tips

When implementing new features or fixing bugs:

1. **New Feature Implementation**:

   - First understand how similar features are implemented
   - Reference the documentation for architectural patterns
   - Follow existing patterns for state management and component organization
   - Use the custom hooks provided in the `/hooks` directory

2. **Bug Fixes**:

   - Understand the full component lifecycle before making changes
   - Check for any side effects your changes might introduce
   - Verify fixes across different message types and scenarios

3. **Performance Improvements**:

   - Focus on memoization and component rendering optimization
   - Consider impact on mobile devices
   - Test with large message sets to ensure scalability
   - Use the debouncing pattern for expensive operations

4. **Artifact Modifications**:

   - Follow the pluggable architecture pattern for new artifact types
   - Ensure version control compatibility with any new features
   - Test on both mobile and desktop layouts
   - Verify both storage backends if modifying storage logic
   - Include proper initialization and metadata handling

5. **Version Control Changes**:
   - Ensure timestamp ordering is maintained for version history
   - Test version navigation and restoration thoroughly
   - Maintain compatibility with both storage systems
   - Follow debouncing patterns for content saving
   - Provide proper UI indicators for version operations

## Information Gathering

When you need more information:

1. **Check the Developer Guide** (`docs/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md`) for practical development guidance
2. **Look at related components** to understand patterns and relationships
3. **Reference similar implementations** in the codebase for guidance
4. **Examine version control system** for complex artifact interactions
5. **Check localStorage in browser** for document versions during development
6. **Review custom hooks** to understand state management patterns

Always prioritize understanding the existing architecture and patterns before making significant changes to ensure consistency and maintainability.
